Postmortem: The Great Web Application Downtime Debacle

Issue Summary:

Duration: April 10, 2024, 8:00 AM - 11:30 AM (UTC)
Impact: Our web application took an unexpected siesta, leaving users scratching their heads and hitting refresh like it's the snooze button. Approximately 40% of users found themselves locked out of our digital realm, causing a mini digital riot.
Timeline:

Detection Time: April 10, 2024, 8:00 AM (UTC)
Detection Method: Our trusty monitoring system raised its hand like an eager student, alerting us to increased latency and API errors – a digital distress signal if there ever was one.
Actions Taken:
Investigated frontend servers like detectives in a mystery novel, looking for clues amidst the tangled wires and server logs.
Suspected a rogue deployment, but turns out our code was innocent – just as surprised as we were.
Checked third-party services for signs of mischief, but they were as innocent as a newborn kitten.
Misleading Paths:
Fell for the classic "it's the network" trap, but alas, the network was innocent – just doing its job.
Thought it might be a caching conundrum, but cache configurations were as clear as a cloudless sky.
Escalation:
Called in the Infrastructure team for backup like the cavalry riding to the rescue.
Database administrators joined the party to analyze database performance – they brought snacks, so it was all good.
Root Cause and Resolution:

Root Cause: The culprit behind the chaos? A sneaky database deadlock caused by a race condition in concurrent transactions – the digital equivalent of a traffic jam in cyberspace.
Resolution:
Implemented database transaction isolation levels to keep transactions in line – no more cutting in front of each other.
Optimized database queries to grease the wheels of progress and prevent future traffic snarls.
Corrective and Preventative Measures:

Improvements/Fixes:
Supercharged monitoring to catch any future database deadlock shenanigans in the act.
Installed transaction retry mechanisms in the application code – because everyone deserves a second chance, even database transactions.
Tasks:

Database Transaction Review: Like a digital detective, comb through database transactions for any signs of trouble – magnifying glass optional.
Documentation Update: Chronicle the saga of the downtime, complete with heroes, villains, and unexpected plot twists, for future generations.
Developer Training: School developers on the art of handling concurrent transactions – think of it as a crash course in digital diplomacy.
Load Testing: Stress test the application like a weightlifter at the gym – because a strong application is a happy application.

Behold, the tale of The Great Web Application Downtime Debacle – a cautionary tale of digital mishaps, detective work, and triumphant resolution. Let's learn from our misadventures and emerge stronger, wiser, and with fewer database deadlocks.
